Our team selected the Predictive Stock Management System because inventory management is a real problem faced by many businesses. Stores and warehouses often struggle with stock shortages or overstocking. We wanted to build a system that not only tracks inventory but also predicts future demand. This makes the project practical and meaningful.

The project also connects well with our AIML background since prediction and data analysis are involved. It allows us to apply what we learn in a real-world context.

Roles were assigned based on strengths:

Tanisha Tiwari – Project Manager
Handles coordination, timelines, and team communication.

Anvitha K – Lead Developer
Focuses on system design and implementation.

Hari Varsha M – Documentation Lead & QA Lead
Manages reports, documentation, and testing.

We decided to hold regular meetings to track progress and solve issues. This clear structure helped us start the project confidently and stay organized.
