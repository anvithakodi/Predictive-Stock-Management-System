The scope boundaries define the limits of the system by clearly separating what the system will and will not do.

Scope Boundaries

The system focuses only on inventory management and prediction

Predictions are based on historical data, not real-time market conditions

Users must manually enter stock updates

The system supports limited user roles (Admin and User)

It does not handle billing, invoicing, or payment processing

The system is designed for small to medium businesses

Defining these boundaries helps avoid scope creep and ensures the project stays focused and achievable.
