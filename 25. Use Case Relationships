Aim

To identify and define include and extend relationships among the use cases of the Predictive Stock Management System.

Definition
Include Relationship

An include relationship is used when a use case always requires another use case to be executed.

Extend Relationship

An extend relationship is used when a use case optionally adds functionality to another use case based on certain conditions.
