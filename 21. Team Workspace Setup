Aim

To set up and configure a team workspace using a CASE tool (StarUML / Visual Paradigm) for collaborative development of the Predictive Stock Management System.

Software Requirements

CASE Tool: StarUML / Visual Paradigm

Collaboration Support: Shared project files / Team repository

Operating System: Windows / macOS / Linux

Tool Selected

Visual Paradigm / StarUML

Team Details

Team Members: Project Manager, System Analyst, Designer, Developer

Project Name: Predictive Stock Management System

Procedure
Step 1: Create Team Workspace

Launch the CASE tool.

Create a new project named Predictive Stock Management System.

Enable team collaboration or shared workspace option.

Step 2: Set Up Shared Repository

Create a central repository (local shared folder or cloud-based repository).

Store the project file in the shared workspace.

Ensure all team members have access permissions.

Step 3: Add Team Members

Register team members in the workspace.

Assign roles:

Admin: Project Manager

Designer: UML Diagram Creation

Analyst: Requirement & Use Case Modeling

Developer: Class and Sequence Diagrams

Step 4: Configure Collaboration Rules

Define version control rules for project updates.

Assign responsibilities for each UML diagram.

Schedule regular synchronization of the workspace.

Step 5: Collaborative Diagram Development

Team members collaboratively worked on:

Use Case Diagram

Class Diagram

Sequence Diagram

Activity Diagram

Each member updated their assigned diagrams and synchronized changes with the team workspace.

Step 6: Save and Backup

Save the updated project regularly.

Maintain backup copies of the project files.

Result

The team workspace was successfully set up using the CASE tool. All team members collaborated effectively on UML modeling for the Predictive Stock Management System.

Conclusion

The team workspace setup enabled efficient collaboration, version control, and task distribution. This improved coordination and ensured consistency in system design.
