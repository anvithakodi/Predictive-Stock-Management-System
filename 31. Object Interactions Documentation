Aim

To document the object interactions involved in the sequence diagrams of the Predictive Stock Management System, showing how objects communicate through messages to accomplish system tasks.

Definition

Object interaction represents the exchange of messages between objects over time to perform a specific functionality within the system.

Documented Object Interactions
1. Object Interaction: Login to System

Objects Involved:
User → LoginUI → AuthenticationService → UserDatabase

Interaction Flow

User sends enterCredentials() to LoginUI

LoginUI sends validateUser() to AuthenticationService

AuthenticationService sends checkCredentials() to UserDatabase

UserDatabase returns authentication result

AuthenticationService sends loginStatus() to LoginUI

LoginUI displays access result to User

Result:
User is authenticated and logged into the system.

2. Object Interaction: Record Sales and Update Inventory

Objects Involved:
InventoryStaff / SalesSystem → SalesModule → InventoryModule → Database

Interaction Flow

Sales data is sent using submitSalesData()

SalesModule sends validateSalesData()

SalesModule stores data using saveSalesRecord()

InventoryModule receives updateStock()

InventoryModule updates quantity in Database

Result:
Sales data is recorded and inventory levels are updated.

3. Object Interaction: Predict Stock Demand

Objects Involved:
StoreManager → PredictionModule → SalesData → PredictionModel → Inventory

Interaction Flow

StoreManager sends requestPrediction()

PredictionModule sends fetchSalesData()

SalesData returns historical records

PredictionModel performs analyzeTrends()

PredictionModel sends generateForecast()

Prediction results are sent to StoreManager

Result:
Predicted stock demand is generated and displayed.

4. Object Interaction: Place Restock Order

Objects Involved:
StoreManager → InventoryModule → RestockOrder → Supplier → Database

Interaction Flow

StoreManager sends createRestockOrder()

InventoryModule sends checkStockLevel()

RestockOrder sends placeOrder()

Supplier receives orderNotification()

Database stores order details

Result:
Restock order is successfully placed with the supplier.

Object Interaction Summary Table
Interaction ID	Use Case	Key Objects Involved
OI-01	Login to System	User, Auth Service
OI-02	Record Sales & Inventory	Sales, Inventory
OI-03	Predict Stock Demand	Prediction Model
OI-04	Place Restock Order	Supplier, Order
Result

Object interactions for all critical sequence diagrams were clearly documented, showing message flow and object collaboration.

Conclusion

Documenting object interactions provides a clear understanding of runtime behavior and message exchange. The Predictive Stock Management System’s sequence diagrams effectively represent object communication.
