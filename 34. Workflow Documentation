Aim

To document complex system workflows of the Predictive Stock Management System, highlighting decision points and parallel activities using activity-oriented descriptions.

Workflow 1: Inventory Monitoring and Demand Prediction
Description

This workflow represents continuous monitoring of inventory, prediction of future stock demand, and alert generation using parallel system activities.

Workflow Steps

Start

Collect real-time sales data

Update inventory records

Decision Point: Is inventory below reorder level?

No: Continue monitoring

Yes: Proceed to prediction process

Parallel Activities Begin (Fork):

Analyze historical sales data

Fetch seasonal and trend data

Combine analysis results

Generate stock demand prediction

Decision Point: Is predicted demand higher than available stock?

Yes: Generate restock alert

No: Continue monitoring

Display prediction and alert (if any)

End

Parallel Activities

Sales trend analysis

Seasonal pattern evaluation

Outcome

System proactively predicts demand and alerts users when replenishment is required.

Workflow 2: Restock Order Processing and Inventory Update
Description

This workflow demonstrates restock order processing with decision points and parallel order management activities.

Workflow Steps

Start

Store Manager reviews stock level and prediction

Decision Point: Is restocking required?

No: End process

Yes: Proceed with order placement

Select supplier

Create restock order

Parallel Activities Begin (Fork):

Notify supplier

Reserve storage space

Supplier confirms availability

Decision Point: Is supplier available?

No: Select alternate supplier

Yes: Confirm order

Update order status

Parallel Activities Begin (Fork):

Update inventory records

Generate restock report

End

Parallel Activities

Supplier notification

Inventory reservation and reporting
