 
1. Introduction

This design document describes the architectural, structural, and behavioral design decisions made while developing the Predictive Stock Management System. The system is designed using object-oriented principles and modeled using UML diagrams with a CASE tool.

2. Design Objectives

The main objectives of the system design are:

To ensure scalability for future growth

To maintain modularity and ease of maintenance

To support accurate stock demand prediction

To enable efficient inventory management

To allow collaboration and reuse through UML-based modeling

3. Architectural Design Decisions
3.1 Layered Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture:

Presentation Layer – User Interface

Business Logic Layer – Inventory, Sales, Prediction, Supplier modules

Data Layer – Centralized database

Reason:
Layered architecture improves separation of concerns, security, and maintainability.

3.2 Component-Based Design

The system is divided into independent components such as:

Inventory Management

Sales Management

Prediction Engine

Supplier Management

Reporting

Reason:
Component-based design allows independent development, testing, and future replacement of modules.

4. UML Design Decisions
4.1 Use Case Design

Use cases were designed to represent core system functionalities.

Include relationships were used for mandatory actions like authentication.

Extend relationships were used for optional actions like alerts and exports.

Reason:
This reduces redundancy and improves clarity of system behavior.

4.2 Class Design

A User superclass was created to avoid duplication of common attributes.

Specialized classes (Admin, StoreManager, InventoryStaff) inherit from User.

Classes were designed with single responsibility in mind.

Reason:
Inheritance improves code reuse and simplifies maintenance.

4.3 Relationship Design

Inheritance used for user roles

Aggregation used where objects exist independently (Inventory–Product)

Association used for functional interactions (PredictionModel–SalesData)

Reason:
These relationships accurately represent real-world dependencies.

5. Behavioral Design Decisions
5.1 Sequence Diagrams

Sequence diagrams were created for critical system operations.

Alternative flows were included to handle errors and exceptions.

Reason:
This ensures robust handling of real-world scenarios.

5.2 Activity and Workflow Design

Activity diagrams include decision points and parallel activities.

Fork–join mechanisms were used for concurrent processes like analysis and notification.

Reason:
This improves system efficiency and models realistic workflows.

6. Data Design Decisions

Centralized database design was chosen to maintain data consistency.

Separate entities for sales, inventory, predictions, and orders were maintained.

Reason:
This improves data integrity and simplifies reporting and analysis.

7. Prediction Engine Design

Prediction engine is designed as a separate component.

Uses historical sales data and trends for forecasting.

Reason:
Isolation allows future enhancement or replacement of prediction algorithms without affecting other modules.

8. Security Design Decisions

User authentication is mandatory before accessing system features.

Role-based access control is implemented.

Reason:
Ensures data security and controlled access to sensitive operations.

9. Design Constraints

CASE tool limitations

Availability of historical sales data

System performance constraints

10. Conclusion

The design of the Predictive Stock Management System emphasizes modularity, scalability, and clarity. UML-based modeling using a CASE tool enabled systematic representation of system structure and behavior. The design decisions ensure the system is maintainable, extensible, and suitable for real-world inventory management.
