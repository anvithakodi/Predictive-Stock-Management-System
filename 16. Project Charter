1. Project Background

Organizations managing inventory often face challenges such as overstocking, stockouts, high holding costs, and inefficient demand forecasting. Traditional stock management systems rely heavily on historical data and manual decision-making, which limits responsiveness to market fluctuations.

The Predictive Stock Management System aims to address these challenges by leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques to forecast demand accurately and optimize inventory levels. This system will support proactive decision-making, reduce operational costs, and improve overall supply chain efficiency.

2. Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to design and implement a predictive system that forecasts inventory requirements and assists businesses in maintaining optimal stock levels while minimizing waste and shortages.

3. Project Objectives

Develop a predictive model to forecast product demand using historical and real-time data

Reduce inventory holding costs and stockouts

Improve accuracy and efficiency of inventory planning

Provide actionable insights through dashboards and reports

Automate stock replenishment recommendations
