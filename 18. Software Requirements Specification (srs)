1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to provide a detailed description of the requirements for the Predictive Stock Management System (PSMS). This document is intended to be submitted online as part of an academic/project deliverable and serves as a formal agreement between stakeholders, developers, and end users.

The SRS clearly defines the system’s functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, assumptions, and interfaces to ensure a shared understanding of the system before development begins.

1.2 Document Conventions

Shall indicates a mandatory requirement.

Should indicates a recommended requirement.

May indicates an optional requirement.

All headings follow IEEE SRS-style formatting for clarity and online submission.

1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions

This document is intended for:

Project supervisors and evaluators

System analysts and designers
