Use Case Descriptions

Structural Model

Class Diagram

Object Diagram

Behavioral Model

Sequence Diagram

Activity Diagram

State Diagram

Data Model

Sales Data

Inventory Data

Prediction Data

System Components

Stock Prediction Module

Inventory Management Module

Reporting Module

Step 3: Assign Diagrams to Packages

Created relevant UML diagrams inside each package.

Ensured logical separation of system components.

Maintained naming consistency across all elements.

Step 4: Maintain Project Organization

Grouped related diagrams under appropriate packages.

Used clear and meaningful names for all elements.

Updated the structure as the project evolved.

Step 5: Save Project Structure

Saved the project file in the CASE tool’s default format.

Exported diagrams where required for documentation.
