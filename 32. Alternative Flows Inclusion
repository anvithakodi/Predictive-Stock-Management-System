Aim

To include and document alternative flows in the sequence diagrams of the Predictive Stock Management System to represent exceptional and conditional interactions.

Definition

An alternative flow represents a deviation from the main sequence of interactions due to errors, exceptions, or conditional situations.

Alternative Flows in Sequence Diagrams
1. Sequence Diagram: Login to System
Main Flow

User enters valid credentials → System authenticates → Access granted.

Alternative Flow 1: Invalid Credentials

Condition: Username or password is incorrect

Object Interaction:

AuthenticationService detects invalid credentials

AuthenticationService sends authenticationFailed() to LoginUI

LoginUI displays error message to User

Outcome:
User login is denied.

Alternative Flow 2: Forgot Password

Condition: User selects “Forgot Password”

Object Interaction:

User sends requestPasswordReset()

System validates user identity

System sends password reset link

Outcome:
Password reset process is initiated.

2. Sequence Diagram: Record Sales and Update Inventory
Main Flow

Sales data recorded → Inventory updated successfully.

Alternative Flow: Invalid Sales Data

Condition: Product ID or quantity is invalid

Object Interaction:

SalesModule detects invalid data

SalesModule sends dataValidationError()

User is prompted to correct input

Outcome:
Sales data is not saved.

3. Sequence Diagram: Predict Stock Demand
Main Flow

Sales data analyzed → Demand prediction generated.

Alternative Flow 1: Insufficient Sales Data

Condition: Not enough historical data

Object Interaction:

PredictionModel detects insufficient data

System sends predictionUnavailable()

Warning message displayed to Store Manager

Outcome:
Prediction process is stopped.

Alternative Flow 2: Prediction Engine Failure

Condition: Prediction service unavailable

Object Interaction:

PredictionModule fails to connect to PredictionModel

System logs error

User is notified to retry later

Outcome:
Prediction request is postponed.

4. Sequence Diagram: Place Restock Order
Main Flow

Restock order created → Supplier notified.

Alternative Flow 1: Supplier Unavailable

Condition: Selected supplier is inactive

Object Interaction:

System detects supplier unavailability

System requests alternate supplier selection

Outcome:
Order is not placed until a valid supplier is chosen.

Alternative Flow 2: Order Cancellation

Condition: Manager cancels order before confirmation

Object Interaction:

StoreManager sends cancelOrder()

System terminates order process

Outcome:
No restock order is created.

Alternative Flow Summary Table
Sequence Diagram	Alternative Scenario	Outcome
Login	Invalid credentials	Access denied
Login	Forgot password	Reset initiated
Sales Update	Invalid sales data	Data rejected
Prediction	Insufficient data	Prediction stopped
Prediction	System failure	Retry later
Restock Order	Supplier unavailable	Select another supplier
Restock Order	Order cancelled	Process terminated
Result

Alternative flows were successfully included in the sequence diagrams, covering error handling and conditional scenarios.

Conclusion

Including alternative flows improves system robustness and realism. The Predictive Stock Management System’s sequence diagrams now accurately represent both normal and exceptional object interactions.
