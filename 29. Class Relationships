Aim

To identify and represent the relationships among classes in the Predictive Stock Management System using object-oriented concepts such as association, aggregation, and inheritance.

Types of Relationships

Association: Represents interaction between classes

Aggregation: Represents a “has-a” relationship (weak ownership)

Inheritance: Represents an “is-a” relationship

Identified Class Relationships
1. Inheritance Relationships

The User class acts as a superclass for system users.

Admin inherits User

StoreManager inherits User

InventoryStaff inherits User

Explanation:
All user types share common authentication attributes and methods defined in the User class.

2. Aggregation Relationships
Whole Class	Part Class	Description
Inventory	Product	Inventory contains multiple products
StoreManager	RestockOrder	Manager handles multiple restock orders
Supplier	Product	Supplier provides products
Report	SalesData	Reports use sales data for analysis

Explanation:
The part objects can exist independently of the whole.

3. Association Relationships
Class A	Class B	Relationship Description
Inventory	SalesData	Inventory updates based on sales
PredictionModel	SalesData	Prediction model analyzes sales data
PredictionModel	Inventory	Predicted demand affects inventory
StoreManager	PredictionModel	Manager views prediction results
RestockOrder	Supplier	Orders are placed with suppliers
Admin	Report	Admin generates reports
Relationship Summary

Inheritance improves reusability and reduces redundancy.

Aggregation models logical ownership without strict dependency.

Association represents functional interaction between classes.

UML Relationship Overview (Textual)
User
 ├── Admin
 ├── StoreManager
 └── InventoryStaff

Inventory ◇── Product
Supplier ◇── Product
StoreManager ◇── RestockOrder

PredictionModel ── SalesData
PredictionModel ── Inventory
RestockOrder ── Supplier
Admin ── Report

Result

All required class relationships—association, aggregation, and inheritance—were successfully identified and documented.

Conclusion

Defining class relationships provides a clear structural view of the system. The Predictive Stock Management System follows standard UML relationship modeling for effective object-oriented design.
